# Practice 2.2

### P2.2 - Error Precision when using 1D linear elements. Session's source 
code. 

You can find the session's guide ---together with other extra material 
files---, at professor Toni Susin's [Numerical Factory](https://numfactory.upc.edu/numfactory/subjects/?subject=FEM&version=etseib&lang=en&section=2&subsection=P)

**Disclaimer:** this stuff is provided 'as is'. Please, check it (just in 
case you find it useful), but it's worth you try to write all the programs 
on your own.

If you find any mistakes (or have any suggestions), please report them to

Many thanks,
